# Boosted Blinks

Boosted Blinks is a Blink wrapped in a Torque offer. This means that the Blink can be targeted to a specific audience, so only users who qualify for the offer will be able to complete the action. Theoretically, any Solana Action that can be wrapped in a Blink can be a Boosted Blink.

## How to Create a Boosted Blink

To create a Boosted Blink, you will need to create a Torque offer in the Torque app. Depending on the action selected, you will be given to activate the Blink. Once the Offer is created, you can then just share on X and the user will be able to complete the action provided they have the advanced settings activated in their wallet.
