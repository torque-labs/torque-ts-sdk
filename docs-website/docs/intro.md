# Tutorial Intro

Let's discover **Torque in less than 5 minutes**.

# What is Torque?

Torque is a onchain growth engine that allows users to launch campaigns to drive user engagement and distribution. When campaigns are launched, they are added to the Torque protocol, which is a decentralized network of advertisers and publishers. 

Advertisers create offers which set the audience who qualifies based on onchain conditions, the conditions required for the reward, and the reward structure for either the user AND/OR the publisher. Publishers share offers to the qualified users and receive the specified reward when the targeted action is performed by a qualified user. 

# What is special about Torque?

1. **Onchain Campaigns**:
    - Torque stands out by ensuring that all campaigns are fully onchain, and accessible via a users public key, providing the sovereignty to the user and providing transparency in the process. 
    - Any user can easily query the onchain data via the DAS API to understand the campaign performance, no middlemen involved.

2. **Targeted and Reward-Based Campaigns**:
    - Torque enables campaigns to be precisely targeted to specific audiences using both onchain and offchain data, ensuring that the right users are reached.
    - The reward conditions for campaigns are based on any onchain action, giving advertisers the ability to incentivize participation that's aligned to their business goals.
    - Rewards are distributed as crypto-native assets (tokens), making them valuable and relevant to users.

3. **Publisher and Advertiser Benefits**:
    - Publishers can share offers with users and receive rewards when the user completes the desired action, incentivizing participation.
    - Advertisers benefit from a cost-effective model where they only pay when a qualified user performs the desired action, ensuring a return on investment.
